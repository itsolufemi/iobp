Project Abstract
-----------------------
Social media has revolutionized the speed by which information is shared and
consumed, with platforms that provide a global reach to billions with a few clicks.
However, despite the utility, this wide reach comes with far-reaching consequences
including cyberbullying and harassment and misinformation & disinformation
campaigns. This project aims to address these challenges by developing the
interoperable blockchain protocol (IOBP), a consortium blockchain designed to
enhance online safety across social networks.
The IOBP would create a system for transparency and accountability where digital
content can be managed across several participating social networks. Using
blockchain technology, the protocol assigns unique IDs to media content, allowing for
tracking the content across networks. This will facilitate a more unified content
moderation process.

In its current form, the project is implemented with a console interface.
